<p>The year is 1998 and the day is June 21st, Steven and Deborah Carr 
    welcome the birth of their second child. Two years earlier they were 
    blessed the birth of Danielle’s, Danie for short, older brother Matthew.
    They grew up in the outskirts of Foxboro, Massachusetts, in a small, yet
    lively town, called Norfolk. To give you better perspective, the town is 
    a 10-minute drive Northwest of the famous Gillette Stadium, home to the 
    NFL’s New England Patriots. Danie’s father, a Public Account, owns his
    own business, and mother, is personal secretary to Norfolk’s Police 
    sheriff, ran a respectable and loving household. Danie excelled in 
    multiple sports throughout her adolescence and considers herself more
    of a “Tom Boy” than a “Barbie Doll” type female. 
</p>
<p></p>
    Throughout her upbringing she developed a close relationship with her father due to 
    their mutual love within sport. Because of this love, Danie’s father 
    would be her brothers’ and her sports coach for most of their youth 
    years. Danie took this passion for playing sports into other parts of 
    her live. She thrived off the competitive nature and the feeling of 
    excelling. This drive for purity and excellence sparked an enjoyment 
    in imagery and discovery. Danie at one time within her high school 
    career even want to go into Criminal Profiling. Life had a different 
    journey though; a tour of a neighboring high school gave her access to 
    witness a young lady constructing a Bird of Paradise design out of apple. 
    At that moment, she fell in love with the creativity and art involved in the 
    undertaking and a career among Law Enforcement was only a thought. After 
    High School Danie went to Johnson and Wales, one of two top colleges known 
    for Pastry Arts on a partial scholarship, to receive her bachelor’s degree. 
    Though she had a full scholarship to venture into the Law, the Pastry 
    World won out. She then stared out her next career journey.
</p>
    The quest brought her to a paid internship her last year of college with Walt 
    Disney World, in Central Florida. She completed a 6-month program and 
    sought to return in whichever way she could. That way was to apply for 
    another program though she had already graduated and by the blessing 
    eventually led to a full-time position. Danie worked her way and 
    reputation from a position at the Boardwalk resort to eventually, the 
    infamous, Grand Floridian resort. There, she worked under the tutelage
    of Party Arts Director and Executive Head Chef, Erich Erbicheck. 
    Through dealing with life-long dietary restrictions Danie has still 
    solved her way to reaching the next level of the Pastry World at its
    Sous Chef Position and known to be one of  the youngest to reach that 
    position at Walt Disney World. This love for the art propels her to 
    the continue feeling of having someone try her desert and stating, 
    “I can’t get enough of this, it tastes so good!” Ultimately her goal
    is to one day rise to level of Head Pastry Chef for one of the newest,
    innovative, resort openings that happen around the Walt Disney World 
    Property.
